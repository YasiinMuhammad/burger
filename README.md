This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize, and follows the MVC design pattern.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger -- waiting to be devoured once the burger is devoured it has a delete button that can remove the burger and digest it.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page with customer.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not, and deleted out the database when it digested.
